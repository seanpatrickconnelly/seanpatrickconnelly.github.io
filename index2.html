<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<p>I was called into the case by my friend, the monkey. It seems that wild animals were
eating humans and taking up residence in their domiciles.
I began my investigation in the Sahara, where I met a camel who had eaten a shah and
his entire herim. He moved into the shah's tent and showed no remorse.
